# Quarantine Hub ü¶†üò∑üè†

VR webrtc chat room using aframe & socketio

‚ùó Although webrtc is [officially supported by Safari](https://caniuse.com/#search=webrtc), I've been having problems with it. Use new releases of Chrome or Firefox (if you are using Edge what are you doing on Github?)

Uses [networked-aframe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/networked-aframe), a framework that adds webrtc and socketio support to aframe.

## Client

Deployed on Vercel

https://quarantine-hub.now.sh/

## Server

Running on Heroku (Free plan hence the server needs some time to fire up after a longer period of inactivity)
