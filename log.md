## Description

In times of social distancing, vast efforts are being made to maintain and digitise communications between family members, friends and coworkers. Although this is necessary for the mental health of many, it does not take into account the importance of the encounter with strangers. 

Quarantine Hub is an online platform and multiplayer game for social interaction. Much like chat roulette, there is no task other than to interact with strangers. In Quarantine Hub, however, players are abstract avatars and don’t share any resemblance to their physical self visually. Once players approach another, microphones will be gradually turned on, enabling them to communicate through merely audio. This interaction is intimate yet anonymous, much like calling a stranger on the phone.

## Goals

- Bring people together in light and humorous ways during times of social distancing
- Play with anonymity and intimacy at the same time

## Motivation 

During the corona crisis all measures are taken to maintain commmunication to family members, friends and coworkers.

However, there is a point that can be said about the importance of the encounter with strangers in our everyday life that. Strangers have been, to a large extent, removed  from our social lives. 

I want to create a game that revolves around one and only one thig — interacting with strangers. For this, I am looking into Second Life, Chat Roulette, multilayer games at large and call centers. All multiplayer games strive on the importance of interaction, though little make this interaction the narrative of the gameplay.

How can these non-physical interactions imitation or create the illusions of intimacy? Can there be intimacy and anonymity at the same time?

## Audience 

Internet users, people affected by COVID, humans that situationally live in the virtual, families, friends, strangers. People that are now forced to use online spaces daily.
